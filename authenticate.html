        <title>OTRon identity authentication</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>Encryption alone protects you against someone passively reading your messages, but it doesn't protect you against someone actively impersonating the person you want to talk to. You need to <em>authenticate</em> the identity of your friend.</p>
        <p>OTRon provides two ways to do this authentication: public key fingerprint verification, and keyphrase verification (also known as <em>the socialist millionaire protocol</em>). You only need to do one.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Fingerprint verification</h3>
            <p>Get your friend's public key fingerprint some other way, where you know it's them talking to you.</p>
            <p>If you're talking to your friend now, share <em>your</em> fingerprint with them, so they can authenticate you on their side:</p>
            <p id="own-fingerprint"></p>
            <p>(Options page.)</p>
            <p>Enter your friend's fingerprint here, and OTRon will match it against the fingerprint of the person you're talking to.</p>
            <div contenteditable id="chat-fingerprint"></div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Secret phrase verification</h3>
            <p>You can also use the <em>socialist millionaire protocol</em>, which confirms the identities of you and your friend to each other by having you both enter in a shared secret passphrase. This passphrase should not be known to anyone who might be intercepting your conversation.</p>
